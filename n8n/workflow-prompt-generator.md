Step-by-Step Plan
1. Create a new workflow in n8n
First, we'll create a new workflow specifically for YouTube Audio Library extraction.

2. Set up the main components:
Trigger Node: To start the workflow manually or on a schedule
HTTP Request Node: To download and execute Puppeteer if needed
Function Node: To set up Puppeteer with MCP integration
Puppeteer Node: For browser automation to:
Login to YouTube Studio
Navigate to the Audio Library
Filter for "inspirational" tracks
Extract audio track details and links
Google Sheets Node: To save the extracted links
Error Handling Node: To catch and report any issues
3. Implementation Steps
Let's start creating this workflow. I'll structure it in a way that's compatible with your existing n8n setup:

Create the workflow file structure
Configure authentication securely
Set up the Puppeteer script
Configure Google Sheets integration
Add error handling and reporting
Implementation
Here's the detailed implementation plan:

1. Begin with Authentication Setup
We'll need to securely store your YouTube credentials:

In n8n, we'll use credentials storage for:
YouTube account login
Google Sheets API credentials
2. Puppeteer Script for YouTube Studio Navigation
The core Puppeteer script will:

Navigate to YouTube login
Authenticate
Navigate to YouTube Studio
Go to Audio Library
Apply the "inspirational" filter
Extract all track information (name, artist, URL, duration)
3. Google Sheets Integration
Create or connect to an existing Google Sheet
Format columns for track details
Append new tracks when found
Would you like me to start creating this workflow for you? I can prepare the JavaScript code for the Puppeteer part and the overall n8n workflow structure.
